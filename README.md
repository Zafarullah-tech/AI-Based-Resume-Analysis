# AI-Based Resume Analyzer for Job Recommendation (CS Domain)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Based Resume Analyzer** is a Prolog-based intelligent system designed to analyze Computer Science skills and recommend the most suitable IT job role.

In modern recruitment, IT companies receive a large number of resumes. Manual screening is **time‑consuming**, **error‑prone**, and sometimes **biased**. This project solves that problem by using **Artificial Intelligence, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning** to automatically match candidate skills with relevant CS job roles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a **structured knowledge base** for CS job roles and required skills.
* Implement **rule‑based intelligent reasoning** using Prolog.
* Perform **automated skill matching** with scoring mechanisms.
* Accept **natural skill input** from users.
* Provide **AI‑based job recommendations**.
* Show **missing skills** for career improvement.
* Ensure **reliability and error handling**.

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. User enters their **technical skills**.
2. Skills are converted into **structured Prolog facts**.
3. System compares skills with the **CS job knowledge base**.
4. A **match score** is calculated using logical rules.
5. The **best‑suited job role** is recommended.
6. The system displays **missing skills** for that role.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install **SWI‑Prolog** from: [https://www.swi-prolog.org/](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Resume-Analyzer.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd AI-Resume-Analyzer
   ```
4. Open SWI‑Prolog and load the main file:

   ```prolog
   [main].
   ```
5. Run the analyzer query:

   ```prolog
   start.
   ```
